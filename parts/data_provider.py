    When a data provider inherits from :code:`DataProviderBase`, the values

    the attribute with the name :code:`<attribute>` of the object.

    The DataProviderBase also allows composing data provider by adding sub-
    providers to a data provider object. If a simulation queries a get_method
    from the data provider that the data provider doesn't provide, the query
    is forwarded to the subproviders in the order they were added. The get
    method from the first that provides such a method is returned.
