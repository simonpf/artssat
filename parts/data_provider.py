data_provider
=============

The :code:`data_provider` module provides a base class for data provider
classes. This class provides utility function for the composition of data providers
as well as the overriding of get functions.

    """
    The :code:`DataProviderBase` implements generic functionality for

    - The overriding of get methods with attributes
    - Composition of data providers

    When a data provider inherits from :code:`DataProviderBase`, the values
    returned from a :code:`get_<attribute>` can be overriding simply setting
    the attribute with the name :code:`<attribute>` of the object.

    The DataProviderBase also allows composing data provider by adding sub-
    providers to a data provider object. If a simulation queries a get_method
    from the data provider that the data provider doesn't provide, the query
    is forwarded to the subproviders in the order they were added. The get
    method from the first that provides such a method is returned.
